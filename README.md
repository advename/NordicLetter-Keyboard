# About:

NordicLetters uses the tool AutoHotkey (made by Chris), which adds the functionality to create keyboard shortcuts for software’s, letters, symbols etc..
By placing the correct keyboard shortcuts into the start-up folder, we made sure that we can use those letters always after we booted our PC.
